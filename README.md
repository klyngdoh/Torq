ABSTRACT:

Torq is a car rental marketplace. 

Torq is like the Airbnb of car rentals, where people can put their own cars up for rent. The site will have three important sets of users i.e. The person putting their car up for rent, the person renting it and the administrators. 

All three sets of users will have different privileges. When a user (rentee) wishes to put his car up for rent, he fills up a form which includes the details and pictures of the car. He then waits for approval to proceed to the next stage. On the other end, the administrator receives a request for the car and they can choose to accept the request or deny it. If the request is accepted, the rentee can go ahead and complete the application which includes information like the expected rent etc. When a user wishes to rent a car, he can see a list of all the cars, as well as sort and filter it, that are up for rent and can select the car of his choice. Upon selection, the owner of the car receives a notification and they can decide on whether to accept or decline the request to rent the car. The payment will be completed only after the owner accepts the request.
